				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>This is my personal website that I created to share my content with other people.</p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Curtis Gibson, and I love everything to do with computers.</p>
				<h3>(As of July 2016)</h3>
				<p>I am 20 years old and have lived in Maine all of my life between two locations, the city of Auburn, and for the past decade sunny Wells, Maine.</p>
				<p>I am a developer who primarily deals with Java, as it is my first and favorite language. I have over 5 years experience programming with Java, and have only recently decided to look into programming with other languages.</p>
				<p>I am currently working as an intern at IDEXX Laboratories in Westbrook, Maine as a developer. Although I cannot give out any specific details, I <i>think</i> it's okay for me to say that I am working on automating software testing.</p>
